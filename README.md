# Dog Sitters Business Owner

This is a request from an owner of a small business. She is in strong need of having a web app to manage her employees and to connect them with potential clients. The idea is simple: she needs a system, where either client, employee, or an admin can log in. 

## About request

### Client
The Client can view available dog sitters in her area, their experience, rating, and reviews from other Clients. He can choose a sitter, choose a time and a date where the sitter can come in to take a dog for a walk, add an address, and a payment option. 

### Sitter
The Sitter can add info for her experience and any information about her. The Sitter can leave a comment about the Client and accept or decline an offer. 

### Admin
The Admin can view everything and manage both Sitters and Clients. On the log in you can create an account as a client or register as a Sitter. 

There may be other features, Development Team can add anything they think will help an Owner to reach their business goal.
